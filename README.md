# Visual Cryptography


## What is this project about?
This is a final project of ECE6960-Hardware_Cryptography.
The purpose of this project is to implement and evaluate three
visual cryptography algorithms, XOR, Modular, and Halftone.
In addition to the three algorithms, two applications are developed.
One is to use AES and Visual Cryptography to protect an image.
The other is to generate meaningful shares.


## Repository structure
- src : source code of three algorithms
- applications : source code of two applications
- papers : related papers
- utility : proprietary code
- images : the input images and the secret image

## Dependencies
Please make sure the following Python dependencies are met
- Pillow
- pycryptodome
- numpy
- opencv-python
- pandas


## Run
To run the individual algorithm, please go to src/ and follow the README in the individual folder.
To run the applications, please go to applications/ and follow the README in the corresponding folder.
