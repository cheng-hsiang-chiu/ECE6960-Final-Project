# Visual Cryptography


## What is this project about?
This is a final project of ECE6960-Hardware_Cryptography.
The purpose of this project is to implement and evaluate the three famous
visual cryptography schemes.


## Repository structure
- src : source code
- application : source code of generating meaningful shares
- papers : related papers
- utility : proprietary code
- images : the input images and the secret image

## Run
```bash
```


## Experimental results
