# Applicatons of Visual Cryptography 


## What is this implementation about?
The purpose of the implementations is to demonstrate two applications.
- One is to to encrypt and decrypt an image using visual cryptography and generate a ciphertext using AES and measure the performance.
- The other is to encrypt a secret image using two cover images.
Overlaying the two generated meaningful shares could decrypt and get the secret image back.
