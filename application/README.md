# Visual Cryptography with Meaning Shares 


## What is this implementation about?
The purpose of this implementation is to encrypt a secret image using two cover images (cover_image1 and cover_image2).
Overlaying the two generated shares could decrypt and get the secret image (secret_image) back.

## Files
- main.py : the implementation
- outputs/ : folders to store the shares

## Outputs
The generated shares are located in the folder outputs.
Share_1.jpg and Share_2.jpg are the shares generated by the algorithm proposed in the reference.
Superposition.jpg is the image of overlaying Share_1.jpg and Share_2.jpg

our_Share_1.jpg, our_Share_2.jpg and our_Superposition.jpg are the results using our proposed method.


## Run
```
python3 main.py cover_image1 cover_image2 secret_image 
```
For example,
```
python3 main.py ../images/image1.jpg ../images/image2.jpg ../images/secret.jpg
```
