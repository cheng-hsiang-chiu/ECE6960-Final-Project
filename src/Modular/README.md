# Visual Cryptography with XOR Implementation

## What is this implementation about?
The purpose of this implementation is to encrypt and decrypt an image 
using Module and measure the performance.

To run the code, just need to type in the number of shares images (share_size, 2~8) you
want to create for encrypting, it will give all results in outputs folder.


## Files
- main.py
- outputs : the folder to be created for output images


## Run
```
python3 ./main.py share_size input_file
```
For example,
```
python3 ./main.py 3 ../../images/Lenna.jpg
```
