# Visual Cryptography with XOR Implementation

## What is this implementation about?
The purpose of this implementation is to encrypt and decrypt an image 
using XOR and measure the performance.

To run the code, just need to type in the number of shares images you
want to create for encrypting, it will give all results in xor folder.

If you change the number of shares, or new image, it will clean up
all the previous images automatically.

Photo must be .jpg, if you run another type of photo, error will occur

## Run
```
python3 ./main.py ./image1.jpg
```
