# Visual Cryptography with Half


## What is this implementation about?
The purpose of this implementation is to encrypt and decrypt an image 
using Half and measure the performance.<br />

In encryption process, the source code takes an input image in png format. After undergo the color seperate process to seperate the input image into three share images in the outputs directory, cyan, magenta, and yellow. It will output three files, CMYK_Share1_1.jpg, CMYK_Share1_2.jpg, and CMYK_Share1_3.jpg. Then, the program will convert each share into halftone images and output CMYK_Share2_1.jpg, CMYK_Share2_2.jpg, CMYK_Share2_3.jpg three files. Finally, after encryped each pixel in three halftone images, the program will generate four shares which are CMYK_Share3_1.jpg, CMYK_Share3_2.jpg, CMYK_Share3_3.jpg, and CMYK_Share3_shareMask.jpg.

In decryption process, the source code takes four encrypted share images which are generated by the encryption process. The program will output the decrypted image named decrypted.jpg in the same directory.
